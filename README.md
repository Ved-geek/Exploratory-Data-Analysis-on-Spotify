# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Spotify

Dataset is taken from kaggle. 
The dataset contains the information of artist, tracks, popularity, type of music, durations and many more feature. There were more than 500K rows and 20 features, and the songs were available from the year 1920 to 2021.

I have used Python library such as pandas to upload the dataset and for cleaning as well, and other libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
